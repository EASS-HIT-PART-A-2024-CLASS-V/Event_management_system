# Event_management_system

This project, developed as the final assignment for the EASS class at the university, consists of two main components:

## Backend

The `backend` directory contains Python code that simulates the server-side of the application. It includes functionalities for managing events, handling data storage, and implementing server-side logic.

## Frontend

The `frontend` directory contains a React-based application that serves as the client-side of the system. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the events management system. The frontend communicates with the backend to retrieve and update event data.
